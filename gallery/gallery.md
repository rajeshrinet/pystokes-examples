### Active particles dance to a Hamiltonian beat

Our work shows that the oscillatory dynamics of a pair of active particles near
a boundary, best exemplified by the fascinating dance of the green algae
Volvox, can be understood in terms of Hamiltonian mechanics, even though the
system does not conserve energy. At the heart of this dance, which is a limit
cycle of a dynamical system, is a Hamiltonian, damped  by gravitational torque
and driven by fluid flow reflected off the boundary.

For small oscillations,
this Hamiltonian is identical to that of a pendulum and, like a metronome, sets
the beat of the dance. For large oscillations, the beat can be evaluated with
the same mathematics as for a pendulum, and when damping and driving are taken
into account, agrees very well with experiment. This establishes without doubt
that the enigmatic Volvox dance, rather than being an evolutionarily selected
biological phenomenon, is a physical phenomenon that can be understood fully
in terms of the familiar concepts of mechanics. Our study highlights the
significance of fluid flows and their distortion by boundaries in active matter
and shows that the applicability of Hamiltonian mechanics extends beyonds its
intended domain of energy-conserving systems to time-irreversible, dissipative,
active systems.

## Crystallization at a plane no-slip surface

It is well-known that crystallization of colloids approximating hard spheres
is due, paradoxically, to the higher entropy of the ordered crystalline state
compared to that of  the disordered liquid state. Out of equilibrium, no such general
principle is available to rationalize crystallization. Here, we identify a new non-equilibrium
mechanism, associated with entropy production rather than entropy gain, which drives
crystallization of active colloids near plane walls. This is a new mechanism of spontaneous
symmetry breaking, with no analogue in equilibrium. The properties of the non-equilibrium
crystal, consequently, show remarkable exceptions: strong dissipation suppresses propagating
phonon-modes and turns them diffusive, yet, activity enhances the elastic moduli of the crystal.
An active crystal, then, has reduced phase fluctuations and is less susceptible to the destruction
of long-ranged order, even though it is two-dimensional. The investigation of topological
phase transitions [4â€“8] in these systems presents, therefore, exciting avenues for
future research. There is an excellent qualitative and quantitative match
 of our results with two recent experiments [1, 2].
